1. base line
	goal:			naive code, only one thread execute the kernel from the ref
	difficulties:	figure out the whole framework, cuda functions must be written in .cu file, 
	hours:			1 person * 4.5 hours
	
	Timing 'ref_2dhisto' started
		GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 0.062
		Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 0.07

2. first improve
	goal:			concurrentize the kernel, use 2 blocks, totally 1024 threads for each height, that is input[idx][j]
	difficulties:	atomicAdd require uint32_t data while the bin is uint8_t data, the input is not sequitional because of the padding
