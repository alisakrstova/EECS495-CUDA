1. base line
	goal:			naive code, only one thread execute the kernel from the ref
	difficulties:	figure out the whole framework, cuda functions must be written in .cu file, 
	hours:			1 person * 4.5 hours
	
	Timing 'ref_2dhisto' started
		GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 0.062
		Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 0.07
	Timing 'ref_2dhisto' ended
	Timing 'opt_2dhisto' started
		GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 46.332
		Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 46.33
	Timing 'opt_2dhisto' ended

2. first improve
	goal:			concurrentize the kernel, use 2 blocks, totally 1024 threads for each height, that is input[idx][j]
	difficulties:	atomicAdd require uint32_t data while the bin is uint8_t data, the input is not sequitional because of the padding
	hours:			1 person * 5 hours
	Timing 'ref_2dhisto' started
		GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 0.063
		Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 0.06
	Timing 'ref_2dhisto' ended
	Timing 'opt_2dhisto' started
		GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 1.645
		Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 1.64
	Timing 'opt_2dhisto' ended

3. Second Improvement
 Goal: Make use of shared memory to hold the sub histograms so that the threads can work only on their sections of the data
 Difficulties: Requires initial clearing of the sub-histogram
 Hours: 2 * 1 hour
 Timing 'ref_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 0.068
        Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 0.07
    Timing 'ref_2dhisto' ended
    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 0.171
        Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 0.18
    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' ended

4. Third Improvement

Goal: Improve the concurrency by using more streaming multiprocessors
Difficulties: Calculating row id, column id for accessing the input
Hours: 2 * 1 hour

    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 50 iterations) = 0.042
        Clock Time        (for 50 iterations) = 0.05
